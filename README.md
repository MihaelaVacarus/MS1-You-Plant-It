## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories
    - #### As a user, I want to look up urban gardens in Dublin so that I can maybe grow my own.
    - #### As a user, I want to see what can be planted so that I can get the fruit and veggies that I like.
    - #### As a user, I want to check how much that's going to cost me so that I see if I can afford it.
    - #### As a user, I want to meet people with similar interests so that we share ideas.
    - #### As a user, I want to maybe join a workshop so that I learn more about the gardening basics.
    - #### As a user, I want to be able to contact the company by sending an email/form, so that I am not bothered with calls.
    
-   ### The five elements of user experience
    - #### The **strategy** plane. The focus is renting out urban garden spaces in Dublin, so for that I am creating a website. For the users, the site will provide information on how to get started with growing their own garden in the city, the community and events around it and the convenience of learning new skills while at it. For us as a company, we will get an online presence to display our services and increase rentals throughout different techniques.
    - #### The **scope** plane. Features to be included: request more information form, photos gallery, downloadable activities calendar, send request for information form. Content will span from bundles section with information on pricing and what's included, events on social media such as creating healthy recipes with own products to engage users and information on available workshops to learn more about gardening. 
    - #### The **structure** plane. On the top side of the website the logo will be aligned in the upper left corner and moving along the line, the fixed navigation bar will be centered and contain five sections: ***Home, Gallery, Bundles, Events & Workshops and Get In Touch***. Each section follows an intuitive approach for the user and easily meets expectations by following a similar design. The content is minimalistic, yet informative enough. 
    - #### The **skeleton** plane. [Wireframes] (assets/docs/ms1-wireframes.pdf)
    - #### The **surface** plane. For the font, I have chosen Montserrat Google font with a Sans Serif fallback. Favicon will be added and based on the logo to create cohesion and visual reassurement for the users.
